# ADDER-CHECKER-USING-DO-WHILE
A simple application on do-while loop using c++.


This code is an older version of c++ not using GCC, is just a simple example of looping specifically a do-while loop to check the if the sum of the input exceeds 100, then it will be printed. For at least one input.

This code to work on GCC or the new version like Visual Studio or CodeBlocks may need some changes.
